HONG KONG, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- A slump in visitors to Hong Kong during the first week of October, normally dubbed as the Golden Week for tourists, came as the latest signal that an upheaval that has lasted since June is plunging the city into an economic abyss.
"Visitors to Hong Kong halved from a year earlier during the first week of October, and the employment in the tourism sector is worrying," said Edward Yau, secretary for commerce and economic development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
