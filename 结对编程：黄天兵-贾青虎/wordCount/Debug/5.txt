Hong Kong's overall unemployment rate has inched up 0.1 percentage point to 2.9 percent, with the rate of retail, accommodation and catering up markedly to 4.6 percent. The HKU said in a report that the situation could continue to worsen and residents were much less confident in the job market.
Hong Kong is facing a more severe situation than any other previous crises including the SARS, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, stressing that the economy will be affected for a long time and the recovery will also be arduous.
