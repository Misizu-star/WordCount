"When exports, retail sales and even investment are weak, it is hard to be optimistic about the performance of the overall economy," Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government said. "If the quarter-on-quarter growth rate turns negative again in the third quarter, Hong Kong's economy will fall into a technical recession."
Chan added that the market has already had a pretty clear idea about the current situation although the official figures have yet to be released.
